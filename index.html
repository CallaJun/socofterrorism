					<h2>A Functionalist Perspective on Boko Haram</h2>

					<h3>Boko Haram</h3>
						<ol>
							<li>"People Committed to the Propagation of the Prophet's Teachings and Jihad"</li>
							<li>Emerged ≈2003 under Mohammed Yusuf</li><!--whose fundamental interpretation of the Quran condemned western education-->
							<li>Before 2009: Recruited thousands of followers, many from poor families and between 17-30, fought for establishment of Sharia law in Borno State</li><!--Some would call it a radical Salafist group over a terrorist organization. Some violence, very rudimentary, hit-and-runs on police and civilians-->
							<li>2009 - Boko Haram "uprising" - Yusuf is killed, and second-in-command Abubakar Shekau rises to power</li><!--Tell story-->
							<li>2009 - present: Tactics more aligned with global terrorist organizations - focused on all of Nigeria, significantly more violent</li><!--Examples of what they do and have done-->
						</ol>
				</section>
				<!--Functionalism: assumption that everything that exists in society has a function. What is Boko Haram's function? What is its purpose and how does it affect social structures?-->
				<section>
					<h3>Overview</h3>
					<p>There are pre-existing problems in Nigeria that stem from a corrupt government - including a failing economy and its police force's use of excessive force/extrajudicial killings.</p>
					<p>Boko Haram provides extreme examples of these issues, and ones that illustrate how corruption/high unemployment rates/excessive force harms the government.</p>
				</section>
				<!--Importance of functionalist perspective: It causes us to look at Boko Haram and ask ourselves, why does this exist in society? Why does it have support?-->
				<section>
					<h3>Government Corruption &amp; Failing Economy</h3>
						<ol>
							<li>Recruitment</li><!--Conditions cause alientation and cognitive openings, unemployments = Boko Haram offering financial incentives to recruits-->
							<li>Ineffectiveness exposed</li><!--#BringBackOurGirls, Goodluck Jonathan's defeat-->
						</ol>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Excessive Force and Indiscriminate Targeting: The Joint Task Force’s Response to Boko Haram</h3>
						<ol>
							<li>Extrajudicial killings are prevalent in the Nigerian Police Force</li><!--Different inspector generals of police estimated numbers in the thousands - as high as about 2400 - from 2000 to 2004. However, The Legal Defence and Aid Project documented nearly 3000 in 2004 alone. These numbers - and uncertainty - indicate that the police are unreliable and abusive.-->
							<li>State of Emergency</li><!--December 2011 after BH bombings-->
							<!--Indiscriminate killings - JTF 40/8
							During raids into communities soldiers have set fire to houses, shops, and cars, randomly arrested men from the neighborhood, and in some cases executed them in front of their shops or houses.
							As one prominent civil society activist in the north said: “The abuses by the JTF have created more distance between the people and the government. Ordinary people are alienated by the activities of the JTF, so they don’t want to cooperate.-->
						</ol>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>The JDT's Mistreatment of Boko Haram</h3>
						<ol>
							<li>Yusuf's extrajudicial killing</li><!--Uprising, executed him, social media-->
							<li>Kidnapping</li><!--Transformation = vengeance, more radical, also kidnapping led to Boko Haram kidnapping, reemergence with Bauchi-->
						</ol>
